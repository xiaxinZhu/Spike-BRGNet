# Spike-BRGNet: Efficient and Accurate Event-based Semantic Segmentation with Boundary Region-Guided Spiking Neural Networks

This is the source code of our **IEEE TCSVT** paper, titled "[Spike-BRGNet: Efficient and Accurate Event-based Semantic Segmentation with Boundary Region-Guided Spiking Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750266)".

This is the official repository for our recent work: Spike-BRGNet ([PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750266)）


* **Event only**:  The spike-based computing mechanism of Spike-BRGNet allows it to deal with complex scenarios efficiently and accurately without image frames.
* **A Novel Boundary-Guided Spiking Semantic Segmentation Model**: A three-branch SNN that consists of a semantic detail (SD), context aggregation(CA), and boundary region recognition (BA) branch, respectively.
* **More Accurate and Less Energy Cost**: Spike-BRGNet outperforms SOTA methods by at least 1.57% and 1.91% mIoU on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets with less computation cost, respectively.

## Prerequisites
The inference speed is tested on a single RTX 3090 using the method introduced by [SwiftNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08469.pdf). No third-party acceleration lib is used, so you can try [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT) or other approaches for faster speed.

## Usage

### 0. Prepare the dataset
# DDD17 Dataset
The original DDD17 dataset with semantic segmentation labels can be downloaded here[https://github.com/Shathe/Ev-SegNet]. Additionally, the pre-processed DDD17 dataset with semantic labels is provided here[https://download.ifi.uzh.ch/rpg/ESS/ddd17_seg.tar.gz]. Please do not forget to cite DDD17 and Ev-SegNet if you are using the DDD17 with semantic labels.

# DSEC-Semantic Dataset
The DSEC-Semantic dataset can be downloaded here[https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/dsec-semantic/]. The dataset should have the following format:

├── DSEC_Semantic                 
│   ├── train               
│   │   ├── zurich_city_00_a

* Remember to replace the dataset path in the YAML with your true dataset path


### 1. Training
* Download the ImageNet pretrained models and put them into pretrained_models/imagenet/ dir.
* For example, train the SpikeBRGNet-s on DDD17 with batch size of 32 on 1 GPUs:
````bash
python tools/train.py --cfg configs/DDD17/SpikeBRGNet_DDD17.yaml
````
* Or train the SpikeBRGNet-s on DSEC with batch size of 12 on 1 GPUs:
````bash
python tools/train.py --cfg configs/DSEC/SpikeBRGNet_DSEC.yaml
````

### 2. Evaluation

* Download the finetuned models for DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic and put them into `pretrained_models/DDD17/` and `pretrained_models/DSEC/` dirs, respectively.
* For example, evaluate the SpikeBRGNet on DDD17 val set:
````bash
python tools/eval.py --cfg configs/DDD17/SpikeBRGNet_DDD17.yaml TEST.MODEL_FILE pretrained_models/DDD17/SpikeBRGNet_DDD17_Test.pt
````
* Or, evaluate the SpikeBRGNet on DSEC-Semantic val set:
````bash
python tools/eval.py --cfg configs/DSEC/SpikeBRGNet_DSEC.yaml TEST.MODEL_FILE pretrained_models/DSEC/SpikeBRGNet_DSEC_Test.pt
````
